# PROJECT TEMPLATE (C++)

This repository contains a simple project template for your C++ applications.

## Prerequisites

Using this template requires that the following packages be installed.

1. CMake
2. [Doxygen](#doxygen-updates)

CMake will download and install Google Test in the project directory.

### Doxygen Updates

Update the following values in your Doxygen.in file.

```
(jtlib) â†ª diff  Doxyfile docs/Doxyfile.in

## Set Up

To set up a new project, run the following commands.

```
git clone git@github.com:bminard/project_template_cpp.git
cd project_template_cpp
rm -fr .git
git init
vim README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
make init
git add .
make
```

## Make Output

If the project set up is sucessful, then the make output should look something line the following.
(The tests fail intentionally.)
